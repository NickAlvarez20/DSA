## Project Name
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
## About
This repository contains a collection of algorithmic solutions implemented in JavaScript, focusing on common data structures and algorithms to enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of core computer science concepts. The project includes solutions for problems such as merging sorted arrays, checking for subsequences, identifying palindromes, and finding pairs that sum to a target value.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following installed on your system:
-Node.js (version 14 or higher) No additional libraries are required, as all implementations use vanilla JavaScript.
## Features
This DSA project includes these features:

-Merging two sorted arrays while maintaining sort order.
-Checking if a string is a subsequence of another string.
-Determining if a string is a palindrome.
-Finding pairs in an array that sum to a given target value.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/DSA.git`
## Usage
Navigate to the specific file for the algorithm you want to run. For example, to run the merge sorted arrays script:
`node combine_sorted_arrays.js`

Each file contains an individual script that can be executed independently. Check the comments in each file for specific instructions. Example outputs:
-combine_sorted_arrays.js: Merges two sorted arrays, e.g., combine([1, 3, 7, 9, 11], [2, 4, 5, 10]) returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11].
-is_subsequence.js: Checks if a string is a subsequence, e.g., isSubsequence('aced', 'abcedefg') returns true.
-is_palindrome.js: Checks if a string is a palindrome, e.g., isPalindrome('teet') returns true.
-pairs_calculated_target.js: Finds pairs summing to a target, e.g., pairsCalculatedTarget([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) returns The values that reached target are 1 and 2.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:
-Build understandings for the two-pointer technique for efficient array and string manipulation.
-Understand time and space complexity analysis (e.g., O(n) for merging arrays, O(n) for palindrome checks).
-Improve problem-solving skills by implementing and testing algorithmic solutions in JavaScript.
